As this thesis work is a partnership with the local public healthcare administration \ausl{},
this chapter focuses on providing context on information systems used in healthcare and the trends in digital transformation that have been shaping the sector in recent years.
These have been driven by \ac{IoT} and \ac{AI} technologies,
enabling the automatic acquisition of large amounts of data, which need to be integrated across different systems and analyzed to extract useful information to support clinical decisions, motivating the need for interoperability and knowledge representation.
%
The chapter provides an overview of the complexity of \ac{HIS},
the main medical standards, and, finally, the context of \ausl{} and its digital transformation journey.

\section{Healthcare 4.0}
%=======================================================

As any industrial sector, healthcare is constantly innovated by the introduction of new technologies.
%
The adoption of \ac{ICT} technologies has been driving a digital transformation in healthcare~\cite{Kraus_Schiavone_Pluzhnikova_Invernizzi_2021} which has led healthcare institutions to require new digital capabilities to support their operations and manage the amount of clinical data they produce in order to improve quality of care and reduce costs. 

Compared to other application domains, healthcare is particularly critical for a variety of societal factors, 
including the sensitivity of the personal medical data being handled, the need for high reliability and availability of services, and the complexity of the domain itself, which involves a wide range of stakeholders and professionals. 
%
This makes healthcare generally more conservative in adopting new technologies, making the process of digital transformation generally slower than in other sectors~\cite{Hermes_Riasanow_Clemons_BÃ¶hm_Krcmar_2020}.
%
It is then not surprising that despite the \emph{Industry 4.0} paradigm introduced in the early 2010s~\cite{Lasi_Fettke_Kemper_Feld_Hoffmann_2014} and progressively adopted in many sectors is still far from being realized in healthcare today~\cite{Kotzias_Bukhsh_Arachchige_Daneva_Abhishta_2022}.

Healthcare 4.0~\cite{Tortorella_Fogliatto_Mac_Cawley_Vergara_Vassolo_Sawhney_2020} is a term that has been used to refer to the application of Industry 4.0 technological drivers in healthcare.
%
These include \ac{IoT}, Big Data and \ac{AI} technologies, which ease the collection and analysis of large amounts of data, support the continuous care and remote monitoring of patients and the support of clinical decisions through data-driven approaches.
%
The general consensus is that Healthcare 4.0 represents a frontier for innovation in healthcare towards the virtualization and distribution of real-time healthcare services~\cite{Kotzias_Bukhsh_Arachchige_Daneva_Abhishta_2022}.

The survey by Kraus et al.~\cite{Kraus_Schiavone_Pluzhnikova_Invernizzi_2021} identifies five main areas of research in the context of healthcare digital transformation summarized in \Cref{tab:h40-clusters}.
%
The survey highlights that healthcare digitalization is a complex phenomenon that is studied across multiple axes.
%
The role of participatory approaches to the design of digital solution is also highlighted as a key factor for the success of digital transformation initiatives, as they can help break the barriers to adoption and acceptance of new technologies by both patients and healthcare professionals.

The first two areas of research in \Cref{tab:h40-clusters} focus on the direct impact of digital technologies on patients and efficiency of healthcare processes.
%
This is confirmed in other surveys as well~\cite{Al-Jaroodi_Mohamed_Abukhousa_2020,Tortorella_Fogliatto_Mac_Cawley_Vergara_Vassolo_Sawhney_2020} which identifies the improvement of \emph{quality of care} and \emph{operational efficiency} as the main goals of Healthcare 4.0. 

Namely, improving the quality of care is proposed to be achieved through improved access to patient's past health records together with general lifestyle data to design personalized treatment plans, real-time (remote and on-site) monitoring, and improved utilization of resources and scheduling of appointments.
%
Efficiency is instead targeted through proactive maintenance of equipment, automation of repetitive tasks, and support decision-making thanks to the analysis of data shared across different systems and sources to detect patterns and trends in advance.
%
The analysis maps out several applications of Healthcare 4.0 targeting patients, healthcare professionals, medical equipment and resource management across the whole healthcare organization~\cite{Al-Jaroodi_Mohamed_Abukhousa_2020}, confirming the wide scope of digital transformation in healthcare.

\end{table}

The pervasive scope of Healthcare 4.0 leads to several challenges that span from technical to organizational and socio-economic aspects. 
%
\Cref{tab:h40-challenges} summarizes the main challenges identified in the survey by Kotzias et al.~\cite{Kotzias_Bukhsh_Arachchige_Daneva_Abhishta_2022}. 
%
Among them, we highlight that the main technical challenges are related to data privacy and security but also on data fragmentation and lack of standardization which is a direct consequence of the heterogeneity of systems and the lack of incentives to share data across organizations. 
%
Addressing these challenges require an integrated approach. 
%
On the technical side, the push towards interoperability and data management and integration is crucial to support all other applications relying on it.
%
Al-Jaroodi et al.~\cite{Al-Jaroodi_Mohamed_Abukhousa_2020} propose to tackle the technical challenges through a service-oriented middleware approach. 
%
Recognizing that building healthcare services from the ground up is not feasible due to practical and economic constraints, they argue that leveraging existing systems and services through a middleware layer can facilitate interoperability across heterogeneous systems and enable the integration of new technologies and services.
%
Among the main functionalities that such a middleware could provide, they highlight data brokering and translation to handle data heterogeneity. 

In this thesis, we will look at the emerging paradigm of \acp{DT} \cite{Semeraro_Lezoche_Panetto_Dassisti_2021} as a potential solution to address the technical challenges of Healthcare 4.0, focusing on the role of \acp{DT} as enablers of interoperability and integration of heterogeneous systems and data sources in healthcare~\cite{Alazab_Khan_Koppu_Ramu_M_Boobalan_Baker_Maddikunta_Gadekallu_Aljuhani_2023}.
