abstract = {Decoupling the physical world and providing standardized service interfaces is still challenging when developing Location Based Services (LBS). This lack also hinders the possibility of developing Intelligent services on top of LBS architectures. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer Digital Twin-based architecture that aims to enable the development of machine learning-based Intelligent LBS (I-LBS) that are able to adapt, evolve, and perform Continual Learning (CL). The platform uses Digital Twins to ensure physical abstraction and provide cyber–physical knowledge to the I-LBSs, which is defined as an execution graph of operation modules. Finally, we simulated a use-case for this platform in the complex scenario of Healthcare organization and management where the I-LBS classifies allowed/not allowed trajectories of users inside a real-existing hospital scenario depending on their role in the organization. The use case is implemented as a Deep Learning-based reconstruction task of high-resolution trajectories processed by the DT architecture that also deploys the I-LBS. The platform is evaluated in terms of physical complexity and computational time on the DT side and on both a traditional machine learning setting and a replay-based CL one for the intelligence side to demonstrate the flexibility and adaptability features introduced by the components for dynamic or unseen scenarios.}

A real life case study is analysed to illustrate problems arising during data collection and the differences in results obtained, together with traceable conclusions for improving the performance of production systems, both in traditional and in innovative industrial plants, following Industry 4.0 principles.},

abstract = {Digital twin is revolutionizing industry. Fired by sensor updates and history data, the sophisticated models can mirror almost every facet of a product, process or service. In the future, everything in the physical world would be replicated in the digital space through digital twin technology. As a cutting-edge technology, digital twin has received a lot of attention. However, digital twin is far from realizing their potential, which is a complex system and long-drawn process. Researchers must model all the different parts of the objects or systems. Varied types of data needed to be collected and merged. Many researchers and participators in engineering are not clear which technologies and tools should be used. 5-dimension digital twin model provides reference guidance for understanding and implementing digital twin. From the perspective of 5-dimension digital twin model, this paper tries to investigate and summarize the frequently-used enabling technologies and tools for digital twin to provide technologies and tools references for the applications of digital twin in the future.}

abstract = {The digital twin is an emerging and vital technology for digital transformation and intelligent upgrade. Driven by data and model, the digital twin can perform monitoring, simulation, prediction, optimization, and so on. Specifically, the digital twin modeling is the core for accurate portrayal of the physical entity, which enables the digital twin to deliver the functional services and satisfy the application requirements. Therefore, this paper provides systematic research of current studies on the digital twin modeling. Since the digital twin model is a faithful reflection of the digital twin modeling performance, a comprehensive and insightful analysis of digital twin models is given first from the perspective of the application field, hierarchy, discipline, dimension, universality, and functionality. Based on the analysis of digital twin models, current studies on the digital twin modeling are classified and analyzed according to the six modeling aspects within the digital twin modeling theoretical system proposed in our previous work. Meanwhile, enabling technologies and tools for the digital twin modeling are investigated and summarized. Finally, observations and future research recommendations are presented.}
