    abstract = {In order to address the current disparity between indoor air quality assessment, prediction, and control, this study proposes an intelligent management approach for indoor air quality based on digital twin platforms. By collecting and fusing multi-level, and multi-dimensional data at the physical level, a comprehensive data integration and analysis platform is established in the digital realm, encompassing the ‘Sense-Integrate-Retrieve-Analyze-Feedback’ framework. Various digital technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Building Information Modeling (BIM), and machine learning, are utilized to integrate and visualize multi-source heterogeneous data through a lightweight web-based interface so that data retrieval, rapid prediction, and intelligent control are feasible based on various backend algorithm models. Compared to traditional measurement methods, this system offers broader spatiotemporal coverage, increased mobility, and less disruption to physical infrastructure, which underscores the sophistication of monitoring technology, data integration, and environmental management. The proposed intelligent platform has been validated in a traditional Chinese dwelling, and practical results demonstrate that most air quality problems occur in the early morning of winter while this system can swiftly predict and issue control signals for adjustments in occupied spaces exceeding predefined healthy thresholds. Field measurements confirmed that most air quality problems can be solved within 30 min after their appearance. By eliminating data silos through real-time synchronization and remote intelligent control via the digital platform, it bridges the gap between problem identification by managers and problem resolution by end-users, ensuring timely responses to indoor air quality concerns.}

    abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to ensure the quality of the Digital Twin models that modern Cyber-Physical Manufacturing Systems (CPMS) rely on. CPMS are configurable and intelligent. Environmental and system parameters change frequently. Thus, static models are inadequate. Autonomous mobile robots and the simulation of their movement are important elements of these CPMS. Based on our reinforcement learning-based methodology, we use these robots as an example to show how the Digital Twin automatically improves models that do not perfectly represent the physical asset, making it an intelligent Digital Twin. In our scenario, the behavior of the asset deviates from the simulated prediction, i.e., a simulation gap occurs. The presented approach closes this simulation gap through a three-step mechanism. First, it makes the simulated data and the real data comparable and synchronizes it. Second, it applies reinforcement learning to find patterns in the deviations between the simulated and real data. Third, it learns to compensate for them. The evaluation of this example shows promising results.}

abstract = {Digital Twin was introduced over a decade ago, as an innovative all-encompassing tool, with perceived benefits including real-time monitoring, simulation, optimisation and accurate forecasting. However, the theoretical framework and practical implementations of digital twin (DT) are yet to fully achieve this vision at scale. Although an increasing number of successful implementations exist in research and industrial works, sufficient implementation details are not publicly available, making it difficult to fully assess their components and effectiveness, to draw comparisons, identify successful solutions, share lessons, and thus to jointly advance and benefit from the DT methodology. This work first presents a review of relevant DT research and industrial works, focusing on the key DT features, current approaches in different domains, and successful DT implementations, to infer the key DT components and properties, and to identify current limitations and reasons behind the delay in the widespread implementation and adoption of digital twin. This work identifies that the major reasons for this delay are: the fact the DT is still a fast evolving concept; the lack of a universal DT reference framework, e.g. DT standards are scarce and still evolving; problem- and domain-dependence; security concerns over shared data; lack of DT performance metrics; and reliance of digital twin on other fast-evolving technologies. Advancements in machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT) and big data have led to significant improvements in DT features such as real-time monitoring and accurate forecasting. Despite this progress and individual company-based efforts, certain research and implementation gaps exist in the field, which have so far prevented the widespread adoption of the DT concept and technology; these gaps are also discussed in this work. Based on reviews of past work and the identified gaps, this work then defines a conceptualisation of DT which includes its components and properties; these also validate the uniqueness of DT as a concept, when compared to similar concepts such as simulation, autonomous systems and optimisation. Real-life case studies are used to showcase the application of the conceptualisation. This work discusses the state-of-the-art in DT, addresses relevant and timely DT questions, and identifies novel research questions, thus contributing to a better understanding of the DT paradigm and advancing the theory and practice of DT and its allied technologies.}

abstract = {In the environmental sciences, there are ongoing efforts to combine multiple models to assist the analysis of complex systems. Combining process-based models, which have encoded domain knowledge, with machine learning models, which can flexibly adapt to input data, can improve modeling capabilities. However, both types of models have input data limitations. We propose a methodology to overcome these issues by using a process-based model to generate data, aggregating them to a lower resolution to mimic real situations, and developing machine learning models using a fraction of the process-based model inputs. We showcase this method with a case study of pasture nitrogen response rate prediction. We train models of different scales and test them in sampled and unsampled location experiments to assess their practicality in terms of accuracy and generalization. The resulting models provide accurate predictions and generalize well, showing the usefulness of the proposed method for tactical decision support.}

abstract = {IoT systems based on Digital Twins (DTs) — virtual copies of physical objects and systems — can be very effective to enable data-driven services and promote better control and decisions, in particular by exploiting distributed approaches where cloud and edge computing cooperate effectively. In this context, digital twins deployed on the edge represents a new strategic element to design a new wave of distributed cyber-physical applications. Existing approaches are generally focused on fragmented and domain-specific monolithic solutions and are mainly associated to model-driven, simulative or descriptive visions. The idea of extending the DTs role to support last-mile digitalization and interoperability through a set of general purpose and well-defined properties and capabilities is still underinvestigated. In this paper, we present the novel Edge Digital Twins (EDT) architectural model and its implementation, enabling the lightweight replication of physical devices providing an efficient digital abstraction layer to support the autonomous and standard collaboration of things and services. We model the core capabilities with respect to the recent definition of the state of the art, present the software architecture and a prototype implementation. Extensive experimental analysis shows the obtained performance in multiple IoT application contexts and compares them with that of state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {Optimization and control of Manufacturing Processes seem to be the key-enabling approaches towards Efficient Manufacturing and Zero-defect. Thus, it is of high importance to study what-if scenarios regarding changes of Process Parameters. To achieve this in real time, Digital Twins have to be designed and implemented. Towards this end, in the current work, a specific methodology, originating from process physics is reviewed as a candidate technology for the process level Digital Twin. The requirements are stated and checked one-to-one and respective numerical results are shown. Discussion on Zero-defect and optimization under the prism of Industry 4.0 is presented},

  abstract      = {This work develops a methodology for creating and updating data-driven physics-based digital twins, and demonstrates the approach through the development of a structural digital twin for a 12ft wingspan unmanned aerial vehicle. The digital twin is built from a library of component-based reduced-order models that are derived from high-fidelity finite element simulations of the vehicle in a range of pristine and damaged states. In contrast with traditional monolithic techniques for model reduction, the component-based approach scales efficiently to large complex systems, and provides a flexible and expressive framework for rapid model adaptation---both critical features in the digital twin context. The digital twin is deployed and updated using interpretable machine learning. Specifically, we use optimal trees---a recently developed scalable machine learning method---to train an interpretable data-driven classifier. In operation, the classifier takes as input vehicle sensor data, and then infers which physics-based reduced models in the model library are the best candidates to compose an updated digital twin. In our example use case, the data-driven digital twin enables the aircraft to dynamically replan a safe mission in response to structural damage or degradation.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in intelligent product especially for industrial applications. A special intelligent product was proposed ten years ago, and this paradigm was named ``communicating material'', i.e. materials equipped with micro components able to sense, store and communicate data. Communicating material needs a recursive architecture to be managed with a digital twin. A literature analysis is proposed concerning recursive multi-agent systems and architectures regarding communicating material applicability. The most promising reference architecture was adapted for modelling digital twin of a communicating material under energy constraint. The composition and decomposition mechanisms are detailed to improve energy performance by generating an aggregated product with a global view. An applicative scenario relative to the different aggregation modes between two communicating materials, illustrates the proposed architecture ability.},

abstract = {Recent findings have shown that Digital Twin served multiple constituencies. However, the dilemma between the scope and scale needs a sophisticated reference architecture, a right set of technologies, and a suitable business model. Most studies in the Digital Twin field have only focused on manufacturing and proposed explicit frameworks and architecture, which faced challenges to support different integration levels through an agile process. Besides, no known empirical research has focused on exploring relationships between Digital Twin and mass individualization. Therefore, the principal objective of this study was to identify suitable Industry 4.0 technologies and a holistic reference architecture model to accomplish the most challenging Digital Twin enabled applications. In this study, a Digital Twin reference architecture was developed and applied in an industrial case. Also, Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS) paradigm utilized for the digital transformation of unique wetlands with considerable advantages, including smart scheduled maintenance, real-time monitoring, remote controlling, and predicting functionalities. The findings indicate that there is a significant relationship between Digital Twin capabilities as a service and mass individualization.}

	abstract = {Direct interaction and explicit communication are not always the best approaches for achieving coherent systemic behaviour in the context of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). This is evident when taking into account recent approaches dealing with environment-based coordination such as stigmergy and, more generally, mediated interaction. In this paper we propose a conceptual, formal and engineering framework based on the notion of coordination artifact, which aims at generally systematising implicit communication and environment-based coordination for heterogeneous, possibly intelligent agents. The features and benefits of our approach are exemplified in the Follow-me situation, where an agent\'{y}s action/plan is considered as a model for the action/plan of other agents. We model this class of problems in terms of coordination artifacts, from simple to more challenging cases, stressing the advantages with respect to more "standard" MAS approaches.},

	abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) form the new backbone of digital ecosystems. Upcoming CPS will be operated on a unifying basis, the Internet of Behaviors (IoB). It features autonomous while federated CPS architectures and requires corresponding behavior modeling for design and control. CPS design and control involves stakeholders in different roles with different expertise accessing behavior models, termed Digital twins. They mirror the physical CPS part and integrate it with the digital part. Representing role-specific behaviors and provided with automated execution capabilities Digital twins facilitate dynamic adaptation and (re-)configuration. This paper proposes to conceptualize agent-based design for behavior-based Digital twins through subject-oriented models. These models can be executed and, thus, increase the transparency at design and runtime. Patterns recognizing environmental factors and operation details facilitate the configuration of CPS. Subject-oriented runtime support enables dynamic adaptation and the federated use of CPS components.},

@article{edge_computing_distributed_offloading_2020,
	abstract = {Edge computing is an emerging paradigm to enable low-latency applications, like mobile augmented reality, because it takes the computation on processing devices that are closer to the users. On the other hand, the need for highly scalable execution of stateless tasks for cloud systems is driving the definition of new technologies based on serverless computing. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture where the two converge to enable low-latency applications: This is achieved by offloading short-lived stateless tasks from the user terminals to edge nodes. Furthermore, we design a distributed algorithm that tackles the research challenge of selecting the best executor, based on real-time measurements and simple, yet effective, prediction algorithms. Finally, we describe a new performance evaluation framework specifically designed for an accurate assessment of algorithms and protocols in edge computing environments, where the nodes may have very heterogeneous networking and processing capabilities. The proposed framework relies on the use of real components on lightweight virtualization mixed with simulated computation and is well-suited to the analysis of several applications and network environments. Using our framework, we evaluate our proposed architecture and algorithms in small- and large-scale edge computing scenarios, showing that our solution achieves similar or better delay performance than a centralized solution, with far less network utilization.},

@article{mec_serverless_2020,
	abstract = {Computation offloading through stateless applications is gaining momentum thanks to the emergence of serverless frameworks with inherent scalability properties. However, adoption of a serverless framework in an edge computing system requires careful consideration to keep its advantages unscathed. In the cloud, micro-services are scaled automatically according to demands, but in edge computing this would incur a significantly higher cost than in a data center and cannot be as fluid. This is especially relevant in scenarios where edge nodes are spread across large areas and have relatively small computation capabilities. In this article we propose to overcome this issue by adapting the allocation of demands to the currently allocated micro-services at short timescales, with two alternative mechanisms designed for different target scenarios, both aimed at enabling distributed computing environments.

	abstract = {A well studied problem in the engineering of open MASs is to enable uniform interaction among heterogeneous agents. However, AOSE as a field has grown to recognize that a MAS consists of more than only agents and thus should be designed on multiple dimensions (including the environment, organization etc.). The problem of enabling interaction among heterogeneous entities across dimensions is either not considered, or it is addressed in an ad hoc and non-uniform manner. In this chapter, we introduce a novel approach to use hypermedia as a general mechanism to support uniform interaction in MASs. The core idea is that agents use hypermedia to discover at runtime (i) other entities in a MAS (e.g., other agents, tools, organizations) and (ii) the means to interact with those entities (e.g., interaction protocols, APIs). This reduces coupling and enhances the scalability and evolvability of the MAS. We present a demonstrator that supports these claims. We believe that a hypermedia-based mechanism for uniform interaction in MASs could provide a foundation for engineering world-wide MASs.},

Many problems in distributed systems can be cast in terms of the problem of detecting global states. For instance, the global state detection algorithm helps to solve an important class of problems: stable property detection. A stable property is one that persists: once a stable property becomes true it remains true thereafter. Examples of stable properties are ``computation has terminated,'' `` the system is deadlocked'' and ``all tokens in a token ring have disappeared.'' The stable property detection problem is that of devising algorithms to detect a given stable property. Global state detection can also be used for checkpointing.},

	abstract = {Integrated access to multiple distributed and autonomous RDF data sources is a key challenge for many semantic web applications. As a reaction to this challenge, SPARQL, the W3C Recommendation for an RDF query language, supports querying of multiple RDF graphs. However, the current standard does not provide transparent query federation, which makes query formulation hard and lengthy. Furthermore, current implementations of SPARQL load all RDF graphs mentioned in a query to the local machine. This usually incurs a large overhead in network traffic, and sometimes is simply impossible for technical or legal reasons. To overcome these problems we present DARQ, an engine for federated SPARQL queries. DARQ provides transparent query access to multiple SPARQL services, i.e., it gives the user the impression to query one single RDF graph despite the real data being distributed on the web. A service description language enables the query engine to decompose a query into sub-queries, each of which can be answered by an individual service. DARQ also uses query rewriting and cost-based query optimization to speed-up query execution. Experiments show that these optimizations significantly improve query performance even when only a very limited amount of statistical information is available. DARQ is available under GPL License at http://darq.sf.net/.},

the main actors and use cases, it analyzes and factorizes the integration process
according to various dimensions, and it discusses the methods that are used in each
step. Emphasis is given on methods that can be used for integrating several datasets.
Based on this analysis, the article concludes with directions that are worth further
research.},

	abstract = {In recent years, digital twins have been pervading different application domains -- from manufacturing to healthcare -- as an approach for virtualising different kinds of physical entities (things, products, machines). The dominant view developed in the literature so far is about the virtualisation of individual physical assets, in a closed-system perspective. In this paper, we introduce and explore a broader perspective that we call Web of Digital Twins (WoDT), in which the digital twin paradigm is exploited for the pervasive softwarisation of possibly large-scale interrelated physical realities. A WoDT can be conceived as an open, distributed and dynamic ecosystem of connected digital twins, functioning as an interoperable service-oriented layer for applications running on top, especially smart applications and multiagent systems. The paper introduces an abstract model and architecture aimed to capture key aspects of the idea not bound to any specific application domains or implementing technologies, and discusses their adoption in engineering real-world systems. To this purpose, two concrete case studies are considered, in the context of healthcare and smart mobility. Finally, the paper includes a discussion of a selected set of research directions.},

   abstract = {This paper reviews the breadth of complexity of the design process, products, manufacturing, and business. Manufacturing is facing unprecedented challenges due to increased variety, market volatility and distributed global manufacturing. A fundamental residue of globalization and market uncertainty is the increasing complexity of manufacturing, technological and economic systems. The nature and sources of complexity in these areas are reviewed and complexity modeling and management approaches are discussed. Enterprises that can mitigate the negative aspects of complexity while managing its positives should thrive on the continuous change and increasing complexity. To reap these benefits in the future, manufacturing companies need to not only adopt flexible technical solutions but must also effectively innovate and manage complex socio-technical systems. © 2012 CIRP.},

To adequately tackle them and to comprehensively support the development of the IoT ecosystem, the Agent-Based Computing (ABC) represents a proper and solid modeling, programming and simulation paradigm. Indeed, abstractions, design methods, technology and frameworks related to the ABC have been widely exploited, possibly jointly with other well-established/emerging computing paradigms, to actually develop advanced IoT ecosystem. This survey, an extension of our previous work, reports most relevant contemporary contributions in the field, aiming at assessing suitability of the ABC paradigm for the (current and future) IoT development.},

Whereas the first wave of the new ``AI Era'' was mostly heralded by sub-symbolic approaches, features like explainability are better provided by symbolic techniques. In this paper we focus on logic-based approaches, and discuss their potential in pervasive scenarios like the IoT and open (M)MAS along with our latest results in the field.",

Modern networks involve not only computers but also a wide variety of other interconnected devices ranging from mobile phones to other household items fitted with sensors. This vision of the "Internet of Things" (IoT) implies an inherent difficulty in modeling problems.   Purpose It is practically impossible to implement and test all scenarios for large-scale and complex adaptive communication networks as part of Complex Adaptive Communication Networks and Environments (CACOONS). The goal of this study is to explore the use of Agent-based Modeling as part of the Cognitive Agent-based Computing (CABC) framework to model a Complex communication network problem.   Method We use Exploratory Agent-based Modeling (EABM), as part of the CABC framework, to develop an autonomous multi-agent architecture for managing carbon footprint in a corporate network. To evaluate the application of complexity in practical scenarios, we have also introduced a company-defined computer usage policy.   Results The conducted experiments demonstrated two important results: Primarily CABC-based modeling approach such as using Agent-based Modeling can be an effective approach to modeling complex problems in the domain of IoT. Secondly, the specific problem of managing the Carbon footprint can be solved using a multiagent system approach.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm in which smart objects actively collaborate with other physical and virtual resources available in the Internet. IoT environments are characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity, encompassing devices with different capabilities, functionalities, and network protocols. To address such a heterogeneity, some platforms have been proposed aiming at abstracting away the specificities of such devices and promoting interoperability among them. Nevertheless, the lack of standardization in IoT makes these platforms to often not properly address several important requirements in this context. In this context, reference architectures can define an initial set of building blocks for IoT environments and to provide a solid foundation for leveraging its wide adoption. In this paper, we introduce two recent reference architectures for IoT, namely the IoT Architectural Reference Model and the architecture proposed by WSO2. By analyzing the characteristics of these architectures, we intend to shed light on important issues for future research on reference architectures for IoT.},

First, a five-dimensional digital twin model is introduced that highlights the performance of the data analytics in model construction. Next, a deep learning technique, termed Deep Stacked GRU (DSGRU), is demonstrated that enables system identification and prediction. Experimental studies using vibration data measured on milling machine tool have shown the effectiveness of the presented digital twin model for tool wear prediction.},

In this contribution, a digital twin for truck dispatching operator assistance is presented, which enables the determination of optimal dispatching policies using simulation-based performance forecasts. Proprietary simulation software with limited interfaces, the application deployment in demanding industrial environments, and the integration of real-time sensor information represent three major challenges when realizing digital twin applications for logistics systems. This implementation, therefore, uses an extensible open-source simulation package and it is coupled with an IoT-platform for easy integration of real-time information. The digital twin is deployed as a cloud-based service, allowing for simple deployment and scalability.},

  abstract     = {The Fourth Industrial Revolution in global manufacturing has been attracting much attention due to its economic impacts and high expectations for drastically changing the competitive domain of various industries in recent years. Industry 4.0 affirms that technological change is a driver of transformation relevant to all industries and manufacturing systems. Within this concept, the Internet of Things (IoT) signifies that robots, material handling equipment such as automated guide vehicles, machines, sensors, and other equipment are networked and enabled to communicate with each other. With the rapid growth of integrating information technologies and operation technologies in industry, significant efforts have been made to make manufacturing smart. As a core element of future manufacturing, IoT-aided simulation and digital twin technology are going to challenge and change the fundamentals of manufacturing systems and operations. They are helpful tools to prepare a living model that continuously updates and changes as the physical counterpart changes to represent status, working conditions, product geometries, and resource states in a synchronous manner. Such a digital representation provides both the elements and dynamics of how a physical thing operates and lives throughout its life cycle. This chapter mainly focuses on the application of IoT-aided simulation and digital twin technology in smart manufacturing in the context of Industry 4.0, and provides a reference model. The convergence of the digital world and physical world, an important outcome of applying IoT-aided simulation and digital twin technology, enables smart decisions to be made at every point of manufacturing operations, thus fostering a data-driven smart manufacturing environment.},

The rapidly growing volume and breadth of data that can be captured, processed and forwarded by the smart devices through IoT-related technology, indeed, represent a key enabling factor for making DTs finally ready for prime time, beyond the bounded confines of manufacturing domain. Conversely, the value that DTs add to the management, development and commercialization of IoT systems can have a disruptive impact in the whole ICT landscape of the next few years, further bridging the physical-virtual divide. Such, promising yet challenging, synergy is the topic of this Chapter, in which both conceptual and practical solutions for the integration between DT and IoT are presented as well as the state-of-the-art of main DT-aided IoT Platforms reviewed.},

abstract="This chapter addresses the value and the synergies of combining Artificial Intelligence technologies with Digital Twins. We begin with a high level, but comprehensive review of AI technologies that may be important for Digital Twins. Then we examine the relationship of AI techniques and methods to the progression of capabilities for Digital Twins in general. The properties and architecture of Digital Twins are then analyzed and related to major AI techniques. The objective is to identify those AI technologies that provide a unique advantage in the design and implementation of Digital Twins. The impact on the Digital Twin's ability to meet end use requirements is illustrated through a simple use case. This points to the importance of including AI from the beginning in the design and construction of Digital Twins. In considering additional use cases we map how AI can be applied to Digital Twins in more complex situations. Finally, we provide general guidelines for inclusion of AI to be incorporated during the design phase of a Digital Twin. This includes the use of AI within the Digital Twin itself and in operations where the context is the larger system that the Digital Twin supports.",
