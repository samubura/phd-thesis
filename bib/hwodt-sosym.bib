abstract = {Digital twin is revolutionizing industry. Fired by sensor updates and history data, the sophisticated models can mirror almost every facet of a product, process or service. In the future, everything in the physical world would be replicated in the digital space through digital twin technology. As a cutting-edge technology, digital twin has received a lot of attention. However, digital twin is far from realizing their potential, which is a complex system and long-drawn process. Researchers must model all the different parts of the objects or systems. Varied types of data needed to be collected and merged. Many researchers and participators in engineering are not clear which technologies and tools should be used. 5-dimension digital twin model provides reference guidance for understanding and implementing digital twin. From the perspective of 5-dimension digital twin model, this paper tries to investigate and summarize the frequently-used enabling technologies and tools for digital twin to provide technologies and tools references for the applications of digital twin in the future.}

abstract = {This paper presents a new view of federated databases to address the growing need for managing information that spans multiple data models. This trend is fueled by the proliferation of storage engines and query languages based on the observation that 'no one size fits all'. To address this shift, we propose a polystore architecture; it is designed to unify querying over multiple data models. We consider the challenges and opportunities associated with polystores. Open questions in this space revolve around query optimization and the assignment of objects to storage engines. We introduce our approach to these topics and discuss our prototype in the context of the Intel Science and Technology Center for Big Data},
