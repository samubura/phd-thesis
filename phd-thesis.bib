The evolution of increasingly complex systems requires that their information be organized and managed via digital twins. In addition, the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) will result in an increasing degree of system complexity. These complex systems will exhibit true emergent behavior as AIs modify system aspects as the result of goal seeking and learning. DTs will need to increase in capability, becoming intelligent in their approach. This article presents a discussion on how these Intelligent Digital Twins (IDTs) will evolve and assist in developing and managing complex systems.},

  abstractnote = {The Digital Twin (DT) is a concept introduced at the beginning of the twenty-first century but did not gain traction until the middle of the last decade. It is a concept that was first adopted for tangible industrial products and has since expanded to all manner of products and services. This includes not only application to inanimate entities but also to the biological conditions of people. Digital Twins are rapidly moving into the intangible realm of processes and abstract ideas. The Digital Twin consists of different types to be a framework for the entire lifecycle of the entities. While the Digital Twin today is a concept that is created by its users, the prediction is that its evolution is to be an intelligent platform. This will allow work to move from the physical world into the virtual world with major impacts on efficiency and effectiveness.},

In this paper, the author proposes and discusses two such related models, the Product Lifecycle Management Model (PLM Model) and the Mirrored Spaces Model (MSM) and investigates the conceptual and technical issues raised by these models.},

It is used slightly different over the disparate disciplines. The aim of this paper is to provide a categorical literature review of the DT in manufacturing and to classify existing publication according to their level of integration of the DT. Therefore, it is distinct between Digital Model (DM), Digital Shadow (DS) and Digital Twin. The results are showing, that literature concerning the highest development stage, the DT, is scarce, whilst there is more literature about DM and DS.}

  abstract = {Digital twin is revolutionizing industry. Fired by sensor updates and history data, the sophisticated models can mirror almost every facet of a product, process or service. In the future, everything in the physical world would be replicated in the digital space through digital twin technology. As a cutting-edge technology, digital twin has received a lot of attention. However, digital twin is far from realizing their potential, which is a complex system and long-drawn process. Researchers must model all the different parts of the objects or systems. Varied types of data needed to be collected and merged. Many researchers and participators in engineering are not clear which technologies and tools should be used. 5-dimension digital twin model provides reference guidance for understanding and implementing digital twin. From the perspective of 5-dimension digital twin model, this paper tries to investigate and summarize the frequently-used enabling technologies and tools for digital twin to provide technologies and tools references for the applications of digital twin in the future.}

A general DT for complex equipment is first constructed, then a new method using DT driven PHM is proposed, making effective use of the interaction mechanism and fused data of DT. A case study of a wind turbine is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}
