  abstractnote = {Manufacturing enterprises are facing the need to align themselves to the new information technologies (IT) and respond to the new challenges of variable market demand. One of the key enablers of this IT revolution toward Smart Manufacturing is the digital twin (DT). It embeds a “virtual” image of the reality constantly synchronized with the real operating scenario to provide sound information (knowledge model) to reality interpretation model to draw sound decisions. The paper aims at providing an up-to date picture of the main DT components, their features and interaction problems. The paper aims at clearly tracing the ongoing research and technical challenges in conceiving and building DTs as well, according to different application domains and related technologies. To this purpose, the main questions answered here are: ‘What is a Digital Twin?’; ‘Where is appropriate to use a Digital Twin?’; ‘When has a Digital Twin to be developed?’; ‘Why should a Digital Twin be used?’; ‘How to design and implement a Digital Twin?’; ‘What are the main challenges of implementing a Digital Twin?’. This study tries to answer to the previous questions funding on a wide systematic literature review of scientific research, tools, and technicalities in different application domains.},

It is a concept that was first adopted for tangible industrial products and has since expanded to all manner of products and services. This includes not only application to inanimate entities but also to the biological conditions of people. Digital Twins are rapidly moving into the intangible realm of processes and abstract ideas. The Digital Twin consists of different types to be a framework for the entire lifecycle of the entities. While the Digital Twin today is a concept that is created by its users, the prediction is that its evolution is to be an intelligent platform. This will allow work to move from the physical world into the virtual world with major impacts on efficiency and effectiveness.},

The aim of this paper is to provide a categorical literature review of the DT in manufacturing and to classify existing publication according to their level of integration of the DT. Therefore, it is distinct between Digital Model (DM), Digital Shadow (DS) and Digital Twin. The results are showing, that literature concerning the highest development stage, the DT, is scarce, whilst there is more literature about DM and DS.}

In the future, everything in the physical world would be replicated in the digital space through digital twin technology. As a cutting-edge technology, digital twin has received a lot of attention. However, digital twin is far from realizing their potential, which is a complex system and long-drawn process. Researchers must model all the different parts of the objects or systems. Varied types of data needed to be collected and merged. Many researchers and participators in engineering are not clear which technologies and tools should be used. 5-dimension digital twin model provides reference guidance for understanding and implementing digital twin.

  abstractnote = {Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology surrounded by many promises, and potentials to reshape the future of industries and society overall. A DT is a system-of-systems which goes far beyond the traditional computer-based simulations and analysis. It is a replication of all the elements, processes, dynamics, and firmware of a physical system into a digital counterpart. The two systems (physical and digital) exist side by side, sharing all the inputs and operations using real-time data communications and information transfer. With the incorporation of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), 3D models, next generation mobile communications (5G/6G), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), distributed computing, Transfer Learning (TL), and electronic sensors, the digital/virtual counterpart of the real-world system is able to provide seamless monitoring, analysis, evaluation and predictions. The DT offers a platform for the testing and analysing of complex systems, which would be impossible in traditional simulations and modular evaluations. However, the development of this technology faces many challenges including the complexities in effective communication and data accumulation, data unavailability to train Machine Learning (ML) models, lack of processing power to support high fidelity twins, the high need for interdisciplinary collaboration, and the absence of standardized development methodologies and validation measures. Being in the early stages of development, DTs lack sufficient documentation. In this context, this survey paper aims to cover the important aspects in realization of the technology. The key enabling technologies, challenges and prospects of DTs are highlighted. The paper provides a deep insight into the technology, lists design goals and objectives, highlights design challenges and limitations across industries, discusses research and commercial developments, provides its applications and use cases, offers case studies in industry, infrastructure and healthcare, lists main service providers and stakeholders, and covers developments to date, as well as viable research dimensions for future developments in DTs.},

Driven by data and model, the digital twin can perform monitoring, simulation, prediction, optimization, and so on. Specifically, the digital twin modeling is the core for accurate portrayal of the physical entity, which enables the digital twin to deliver the functional services and satisfy the application requirements. Therefore, this paper provides systematic research of current studies on the digital twin modeling. Since the digital twin model is a faithful reflection of the digital twin modeling performance, a comprehensive and insightful analysis of digital twin models is given first from the perspective of the application field, hierarchy, discipline, dimension, universality, and functionality. Based on the analysis of digital twin models, current studies on the digital twin modeling are classified and analyzed according to the six modeling aspects within the digital twin modeling theoretical system proposed in our previous work. Meanwhile, enabling technologies and tools for the digital twin modeling are investigated and summarized. Finally, observations and future research recommendations are presented.},

  abstractnote = {Nowadays, along with the application of new generation information technologies in industry and manufacturing, the big data-driven manufacturing era is coming. However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed. The detailed application methods and frameworks of digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing, and service are investigated. Furthermore, three cases are given to illustrate the future applications of digital twin in the three phases of a product respectively.},

Digital Twin is one of the most popular terms in the context of Industry 4.0. While not new, this approach has been brought to life with recent technological advances. Digital twins of products should help to analyze their life cycle and optimize development, operation, and service processes. For that, the necessary data must be collected and stored throughout the product life cycle and can also be provided for other tasks. The data is usually available in different formats and at different endpoints. Collection and integration of data into existing information systems are also complicated due to the typically large amount of data and typically manageable only with great effort. The structure and design of the digital twin are currently not standardized. Different are the structures, scope, and design methods. Regardless of building techniques and structure, a digital twin building platform must be defined to bring together models and data from different disciplines and to ensure the benefit of using the digital twin. In the present work, the various platforms that can be used to create a digital twin are examined and compared, since each platform has advantages and disadvantages.},

Digital Twin Web follows a similar structure to the World Wide Web and consists of meta-level digital twins that are described as digital twin description documents and distributed via Digital Twin Web servers. Standards must be established before the Digital Twin Web can be used efficiently, and having an easily accessible server implementation can foster the development of those standards. Twinbase is an open-source, Git-based Digital Twin Web server developed with user-friendliness in mind. Twinbase stores digital twin documents in a Git repository, modifies them with Git workflows, and distributes them to users via a static web server, from which the documents can be accessed via a client library or a regular web browser. A demo server is available at https://dtw.twinbase.org and new server instances can be initialized free-of-charge at GitHub via its browser interface. Twinbase is built with GitHub repository, Pages, and Actions but can be extended to support other providers or self-hosting. We describe the underlying architecture of Twinbase to support the creation of derivative and alternative server implementations. The Digital Twin Web requires permanent, globally accessible, and transferable identifiers to function properly, and to address this issue, we introduce the concept of digital twin identifier registry. Performance measurements showed that the median response times for fetching a digital twin document from Twinbase varied between 0.4 and 1.2 seconds depending on the identifier registry.},

DTs are intended to be a virtual high-fidelity representation of a physical counterpart. Its complex nature requires several components to create and run a DT, and that is why many DT frameworks have been proposed in the literature. There are also many surveys of DTs, but none that is bottom-up with concrete examples and focused on open-source software. This survey analyzes 14 open-source DT frameworks in 10 different dimensions, which are then categorized in six different groups according to their modeling and technological domain, to present the reader different options for creating and managing DT applications, and to understand potential combinations, uses, and limitations of the tools. It also presents a case study with five of the explored DT frameworks, describing the process on how the DT is set up and comparing their capabilities based on the services to be provided by the DT. Finally, it discusses advantages and limitations of the tools according to domain, requirements, and scope, relevant aspects regarding built-in simulations and data analytics, theory-to-practice transition, and advantages/disadvantages of using open-source software instead of commercial. Main limitations of the study due to its narrow niche, conclusions, and opportunities for future research regarding the potential room for improvement in terms of out-of-the-box features and services for DTs, are also shown.},

The objective is to identify those AI technologies that provide a unique advantage in the design and implementation of Digital Twins. The impact on the Digital Twin’s ability to meet end use requirements is illustrated through a simple use case. This points to the importance of including AI from the beginning in the design and construction of Digital Twins. In considering additional use cases we map how AI can be applied to Digital Twins in more complex situations.

In the assessed literature, a variety of problems are approached with an artificial intelligence-integrated digital twin, demonstrating its applicability across different fields. Our findings indicate that there is a lack of in-depth modeling approaches regarding the digital twin, while many articles focus on the implementation and testing of the artificial intelligence component.

This requires integrating all available data, information and knowledge related to the system across its entire lifecycle. It is a challenging task due to the high complexity of modern industrial systems. Semantic technologies such as ontology and knowledge graphs provide potential solutions by empowering DTs with augmented cognitive capabilities. The Cognitive Digital Twin (CDT) concept has been recently proposed which reveals a promising evolution of the current DT concept towards a more intelligent, comprehensive, and full lifecycle representation of complex systems. This paper reviews existing studies relevant to the CDT concept, and further explores its definitions and key features. To facilitate CDT development, a reference architecture is proposed based on the RAMI4.0 and some other existing architectures. Moreover, some key enabling technologies and several application scenarios of CDT are introduced. The challenges and opportunities are discussed in the end to boost future studies.},

However, achieving the full potential of DTs requires addressing interoperability challenges posed by the complex networks of devices and systems that play different roles in DTs. This paper presents a research agenda aimed at enhancing DT interoperability grounded in four perspectives, which reflect knowledge fields in computer/information science, i.e., architecture of distributed systems, model-based system engineering, ontology-driven conceptual modeling, and linked data with semantic web. This paper highlights how leveraging on existing standards, such as modelling languages and ontologies, is important for improved DT interoperability.

An operational semantics is also provided, which shows how this knowledge can be used to achieve particular goals or to form intentions regarding their achievement.

  abstractnote = {Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents have been investigated by many researchers from both a theoretical specification perspective and a practical design perspective. However, there still remains a large gap between theory and practice. The main reason for this has been the complexity of theorem-proving or model-checking in these expressive specification logics. Hence, the implemented BDI systems have tended to use the three major attitudes as data structures, rather than as modal operators. In this paper, we provide an alternative formalization of BDI agents by providing an operational and proof-theoretic semantics of a language AgentSpeak(L). This language can be viewed as an abstraction of one of the implemented BDI systems (i.e., PRS) and allows agent programs to be written and interpreted in a manner similar to that of horn-clause logic programs. We show how to perform derivations in this logic using a simple example. These derivations can then be used to prove the properties satisfied by BDI agents.},

It enables users to build complex multi-agent systems that are capable of operating in environments previously considered too unpredictable for computers to handle. Jason is easily customisable and is suitable for the implementation of reactive planning systems according to the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architecture. Programming Multi-Agent Systems in AgentSpeak using Jason provides a brief introduction to multi-agent systems and the BDI agent architecture on which AgentSpeak is based. The authors explain Jason’s AgentSpeak variant and provide a comprehensive, practical guide to using Jason to program multi-agent systems. Some of the examples include diagrams generated using an agent-oriented software engineering methodology particularly suited for implementation using BDI-based programming languages. The authors also give guidance on good programming style with AgentSpeak. Programming Multi-Agent Systems in AgentSpeak using Jason  Describes and explains in detail the AgentSpeak extension interpreted by Jason and shows how to create multi-agent systems using the Jason platform. Reinforces learning with examples, problems, and illustrations. Includes two case studies which demonstrate the use of Jason in practice. Features an accompanying website that provides further learning resources including sample code, exercises, and slides  This essential guide to AgentSpeak and Jason will be invaluable to senior undergraduate and postgraduate students studying multi-agent systems. The book will also be of interest to software engineers, designers, developers, and programmers interested in multi-agent systems.},

The state of an agent consists of components such as beliefs, decisions, capabilities, and obligations; for this reason the state of an agent is called its mental state. The mental state of agents is described formally in an extension of standard epistemic logics: beside temporalizing the knowledge and belief operators, AOP introduces operators for obligation, decision, and capability. Agents are controlled by agent programs, which include primitives for communicating with other agents. In the spirit of speech act theory, each communication primitive is of a certain type: informing, requesting, offering, and so on. This article presents the concept of AOP, discusses the concept of mental state and its formal underpinning, defines a class of agent interpreters, and then describes in detail a specific interpreter that has been implemented.},

This deﬁnition is the ﬁrst step for a review of the current progress of an illustrative selection of methodologies, looking for missing elements and future lines of improvement. The result is an account of how well the AOSE community is meeting the software lifecycle needs.

MAOP provides a structured approach based on three integrated dimensions, which the book examines in detail: the agent dimension, used to design the individual (interacting) entities; the environment dimension, which allows the development of shared resources and connections to the real world; and the organization dimension, which structures the interactions among the autonomous agents and the shared environment.},

  abstractnote = {Research on Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has led to the development of several models, languages, and technologies for programming not only agents, but also their interaction, the application environment where they are situated, as well as the organization in which they participate. Research on those topics moved from agent-oriented programming towards multi-agent-oriented programming (MAOP). A MAS program is then designed and developed using a structured set of concepts and associated first-class design and programming abstractions that go beyond the concepts normally associated with agents. They include those related to environment, interaction, and organization. JaCaMo is a platform for MAOP built on top of three seamlessly integrated dimensions (i.e. structured sets of concepts and associated execution platforms): for programming belief desire intention (BDI) agents, their artefact-based environments, and their normative organizations. The key purpose of our work on JaCaMo is to support programmers in exploring the synergy between these dimensions, providing a comprehensive programming model, as well as a corresponding platform for developing and running MAS. This paper provides a practical overview of MAOP using JaCaMo. We show how emphasizing one particular dimension leads to different solutions to the same problem, and discuss the issues of each of those solutions.},

In the resulting agents & artifacts (A&A) meta-model, agents are the (pro-)active entities in charge of the goals/tasks that altogether build up the whole MAS behaviour, whereas artifacts are the reactive entities providing the services and functions that make individual agents work together in a MAS, and that shape agent environment according to the MAS needs. After presenting the scientific background, we define the notions of artifact in the A&A meta-model, discuss how it affects the notion of intelligence in MAS, and show its application to a number of agent-related research fields.},

One of these principles is not to assume anything about the cognitive capabilities of agents. In order to show how OCMAS models may be designed, we propose a very concise and minimal OCMAS model called AGR, for Agent/Group/Role.

In that perspective, we aim at exploring the integration of cognitive agent-oriented programming based on BDI with learning techniques so as to systematically exploit them in the agent development stage. The approach should support the design of BDI agents in which some plans can be explicitly programmed and others instead can be learned by the agent during the development/engineering stage. In that view, the development of an agent is metaphorically similar to an education process, in which first an agent is created with a set of basic programmed plans and then grow up in order to learn plans to achieve the goals for which the agent is meant to be designed. This paper presents and discusses this medium-term view, introducing a first model for a BDI agent programming framework integrating RL, a first implementation based on Jason programming language/platform and sketching a roadmap for this research line.},

In this paper, we explore the contributions that agent-oriented programming can make to the development of future intelligent systems. We briefly review the state of the art in agent programming, focussing particularly on BDI-based agent programming languages, and discuss previous work on integrating AI techniques (including machine learning) in agent-oriented programming. We argue that the unique strengths of BDI agent languages provide an ideal framework for integrating the wide range of AI capabilities necessary for progress towards the next-generation of intelligent systems. We identify a range of possible approaches to integrating AI into a BDI agent architecture. Some of these approaches, e.g., ‘AI as a service’, exploit immediate synergies between rapidly maturing AI techniques and agent programming, while others, e.g., ‘AI embedded into agents’ raise more fundamental research questions, and we sketch a programme of research directed towards identifying the most appropriate ways of integrating AI capabilities into agent programs.},

Multi-Agent Systems come in the form of cooperative robots in a team, sensor networks based on mobile robots, and robots in Intelligent Environments, to name but a few. However, the development of Multi-Agent Robotic Systems (MARS) still presents major challenges. Over the past decade, a high number of Robotics Software Frameworks (RSFs) have appeared which propose some solutions to the most recurrent problems in robotics. Some of these frameworks, such as ROS, YARP, OROCOS, ORCA, Open-RTM, and Open-RDK, possess certain characteristics and provide the basic infrastructure necessary for the development of MARS. The contribution of this work is the identification of such characteristics as well as the analysis of these frameworks in comparison with the general-purpose Multi-Agent System Frameworks (MASFs), such as JADE and Mobile-C.},

However, compared to other approaches, e.g., traditional discrete event simulation, object-oriented simulation and dynamic micro simulation, MABS has a number of interesting properties which makes it useful also for other domains. For instance, it supports structure preserving modeling of the simulated reality, simulation of pro-active behavior, parallel computations, and very dynamic simulation scenarios. It is argued that MABS is a useful technique for simulating scenarios also in more technical domains. In particular, this hold for the simulation of technical systems that are distributed and involve complex interaction between humans and machines. To illustrate the advantages of MABS, an application concerning the monitoring and control of intelligent buildings is described.},

  abstractnote = {Methodological Guidelines for Modeling and Developing MAS-Based SimulationsThe intersection of agents, modeling, simulation, and application domains has been the subject of active research for over two decades. Although agents and simulation have been used effectively in a variety of application domains, much of the supporting research remains scattered in the literature, too often leaving scientists to develop multi-agent system (MAS) models and simulations from scratch. Multi-Agent Systems: Simulation and Applications provides an overdue review of the wide ranging facets of MAS simulation, including methodological and application-oriented guidelines. This comprehensive resource reviews two decades of research in the intersection of MAS, simulation, and different application domains. It provides scientists and developers with disciplined engineering approaches to modeling and developing MAS-based simulations. After providing an overview of the field’s history and its basic principles, as well as cataloging the various simulation engines for MAS, the book devotes three sections to current and emerging approaches and applications.Simulation for MAS — explains simulation support for agent decision making, the use of simulation for the design of self-organizing systems, the role of software architecture in simulating MAS, and the use of simulation for studying learning and stigmergic interaction.MAS for Simulation — discusses an agent-based framework for symbiotic simulation, the use of country databases and expert systems for agent-based modeling of social systems, crowd-behavior modeling, agent-based modeling and simulation of adult stem cells, and agents for traffic simulation. Tools — presents a number of representative platforms and tools for MAS and simulation, including Jason, James II, SeSAm, and RoboCup Rescue.Complete with over 200 figures and formulas, this reference book provides the necessary overview of experiences with MAS simulation and the tools needed to exploit simulation in MAS for future research in a vast array of applications including home security, computational systems biology, and traffic management.},

  abstractnote = {Traditionally, distributed computing concentrates on computation understood at the level of information exchange and sets aside human and organizational concerns as largely to be handled in an ad hoc manner. Increasingly, however, distributed applications involve multiple loci of autonomy. Research in multiagent systems (MAS) addresses autonomy by drawing on concepts and techniques from artificial intelligence. However, MAS research generally lacks an adequate understanding of modern distributed computing. In this Blue Sky paper, we envision decentralized multiagent systems as a way to place decentralized intelligence in distributed computing, specifically, by supporting computation at the level of social meanings. We motivate our proposals for research in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), which has become a major thrust in distributed computing. From the IoT’s representative applications, we abstract out the major challenges of relevance to decentralized intelligence. These include the heterogeneity of IoT components; asynchronous and delay-tolerant communication and decoupled enactment; and multiple stakeholders with subtle requirements for governance, incorporating resource usage, cooperation, and privacy. The IoT yields high-impact problems that require solutions that go beyond traditional ways of thinking. We conclude with highlights of some possible research directions in decentralized MAS, including programming models; interaction-oriented software engineering; and what we term enlightened governance.},

DALI has been validated by traffic engineers as well as through extensive simulation of the City of Richardson’s traffic network, comprising 128 signalized intersections.

Few people, however, realize that the Web was born at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva, and that it was invented by an Englishman, Tim Berners-Lee. Offering its readers an unprecedented “insider’s” perspective, this new book was co-written by two CERN employees--one of whom, Robert Cailliau, was among the Web’s pioneers. It tells how the idea for the Web came about at CERN, how it was developed, and how it was eventually handed over at no charge for the rest of the world to use. The first book-length account of the Web’s development, How the Web was Born draws upon several interviews with the key players in this amazing story. This compelling and highly topical book is certain to interest all general readers with a taste for the Web or the Internet, as well as students and teachers of computing, technology, and applied science.},

The Web marks the end of an era of frustrating and debilitating incompatibility between computer systems. It has created an explosion of accessibility, with many potential social and economical impacts. The Web was designed to be a space within which people could work on a project. This was a powerful concept, in that: people who build a hypertext document of their shared understanding can refer to it at all times; people who join a project team can have access to a history of the team’s activities, decisions, and so on; the work of people who leave a team can be captured for future reference; and a team’s operations, if placed on the Web, can be machine-analyzed in a way that could not be done otherwise. The Web was originally supposed to be a personal information system and a tool for groups of all sizes, from a team of two to the entire world.

Since its inception, opinions have remained divided regarding the past, present and potential future impact of the Semantic Web. In this paper – and in light of the results of over two decades of development on both the Semantic Web and related technologies – we reflect on the current status of the Semantic Web, the impact it has had thus far, and future challenges. We first review some of the external criticism of this vision that has been put forward by various authors; we draw together the individual critiques, arguing both for and against each point based on the current state of adoption. We then present the results of a questionnaire that we have posed to the Semantic Web mailing list in order to understand respondents’ perspective(s) regarding the degree to which the original Semantic Web vision has been realised, the impact it can potentially have on the Web (and other settings), its success stories thus far, as well as the degree to which they agree with the aforementioned critiques of the Semantic Web in terms of both its current state and future feasibility. We conclude by reflecting on future challenges and opportunities in the area.},

The integration of physical things into the Web so far has not been done on a large scale, which makes it harder to realize network effects that could emerge by the combination of today’s Web content, and the integration of physical things into the Web. This paper presents a path towards a Web where physical objects are made available through RESTful principles. By using this architectural style for pervasive and ubiquitous computing scenarios, they will scale better, integrate better with other applications, and pave the path towards a “Web of Things” that seamlessly integrates conceptual and physical resources.},

  abstractnote = {Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues this ingenious-even liberating-book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how-and why-some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.},

                  The basic assumption is that vision depends on the eye which is connected to the brain. The author suggests that natural vision depends on the eyes in the head on a body supported by the ground, the brain being only the central organ of a complete visual system. When no constraints are put on the visual system, people look around, walk up to something interesting and move around it so as to see it from all sides, and go from one vista to another. That is natural vision -- and what this book is about.},

IoT needs to be pushed towards a more open, interoperable and collaborative IoT. The first step has been the Web of Things (WoT). WoT evolves the IoT with a common stack based on web services. But, even when a homogeneous access is reached through web protocols, a common understanding is not yet acquired. For this purpose, the Semantic Web of Things (SWoT) is proposed for the integration of the semantic web on the WoT. This work analyses the SWoT, presenting its different levels to offer an IoT convergence. Specifically, we analyse the trends for capillary networks and for cellular networks with standards such as IPSO, ZigBee, OMA, and the oneM2M initiative.

To overcome these two challenges, we propose WoTwins, a framework that, on one side, leverages the W3C Web of Things (WoT) standard to model data and entities, and, on the other side, generates automatically Digital Twins of existing Web Things by modeling their state space through a Markov Decision Process (MDP) graph and by predicting its behavior though Machine Learning techniques.

  abstractnote = {Industry 4.0 is revolutionizing industrial production by bridging the physical and the virtual worlds and further improving digitalization. Two essential building blocks in industry 4.0 are digital twins (DT) and the internet of things (IoT). While IoT is about connecting resources and collecting data about the physical world, DTs are the virtual representations of resources organizing and managing information and being tightly integrated with artificial intelligence, machine learning and cognitive services to further optimize and automate production. The concepts of DTs and IoT are overlapping when it comes to describing, discovering and accessing resources. Currently, there are multiple DT and IoT standards covering these overlapping aspects created by different organizations with different backgrounds and perspectives. With regard to interoperability, which is presumably the most important aspect of industry 4.0, this barrier needs to be overcome by consolidation of standards. The objective of this paper is to investigate current DT and IoT standards and provide insights to stimulate this consolidation. Overlapping aspects are identified and a classification scheme is created and applied to the standards. The results are compared, aspects with high similarity or divergence are identified and a proposal for stimulating consolidation is presented. Consensus between standards are found regarding the elements a resource should consist of and which serialization format(s) and network protocols to use. Controversial topics include which query language to use for discovery as well as if geo-spatial, temporal and historical data should be explicitly supported.},
