They have progressively gained popularity over the past years because of intense research activity and industrial advancements. Cognitive Twins is a novel concept, recently coined to refer to the involvement of Semantic Web technology in DTs. Recent studies address the relevance of ontologies and knowledge graphs in the context of DTs, in terms of knowledge representation, interoperability and automatic reasoning. However, there is no comprehensive analysis of how semantic technologies, and specifically ontologies, are utilized within DTs. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is based on the analysis of 82 research articles, that either propose or benefit from ontologies with respect to DT. The paper uses different analysis perspectives, including a structural analysis based on a reference DT architecture, and an application-specific analysis to specifically address the different domains, such as Manufacturing and Infrastructure. The review also identifies open issues and possible research directions on the usage of ontologies and knowledge graphs in DTs.},

	abstract = {Digital twin (DT), which strives to achieve physical-virtual fusion, has made great strides with its widely applications in various fields. Based on data interaction, DT reflects the real-time conditions of physical scenarios in a safe-virtual space and further generates dynamic decisions. However, there are still some vital challenges to be addressed during the implementation of DT. A crucial challenge lies in bridging the gap between the physical and virtual spaces, in order to realize physical-virtual consistency. To address the challenge, an ontology-based data-model coupling method is firstly proposed in this paper, consisting of three primary procedures, relation establishment, data-model coupling and relation evolution. Subsequently, detailed implementations of the above procedures are illustrated. Finally, experiments are carried out to prove the feasibility and practicability of the proposed method.},

It can bring beneﬁts such as simulation, monitoring or management once it joins the physical and the virtual through the Internet of Things. This concept is being adopted more and more in the academia and in the industry, but there is still a lack of methods to deﬁne and formalize the representation of the Digital Twin, as for example semantic models. Ontologies are a way of representing knowledge that can be shared between different entities, allowing a common understanding about a information. In this sense, this work proposes an ontology to represent Digital Twin in the context of CPS and embedded systems. These concepts are implemented through a proposed architecture. The proposed ideas are being evaluated with industrial case studies and some of the preliminary results are described in the paper.},

	abstract = {Digital Twin (DT) is the imitation of the real world product, process or system. Digital Twin is the ideal solution for data-driven optimisations in different phases of the product lifecycle. With the rapid growth in DT research, data management for digital twin is a challenging field for both industries and academia. The challenges for DT data management are analysed in this article are data variety, big data \& data mining and DT dynamics. The current research proposes a novel concept of DT ontology model and methodology to address these data management challenges. The DT ontology model captures and models the conceptual knowledge of the DT domain. Using the proposed methodology, such domain knowledge is transformed into a minimum data model structure to map, query and manage databases for DT applications. The proposed research is further validated using a case study based on Condition-Based Monitoring (CBM) DT application. The query formulation around minimum data model structure further shows the effectiveness of the current approach by returning accurate results, along with maintaining semantics and conceptual relationships along DT lifecycle. The method not only provides flexibility to retain knowledge along DT lifecycle but also helps users and developers to design, maintain and query databases effectively for DT applications and systems of different scale and complexities.},

	abstract = {The development and progress in information and communication technologies will transform traditional products into smart products and allow to offer novel smart services [1]. Herein, the digital twin (DT) concept is regarded as a key technology to create value with smart services [2]. Although the research and applications of DTs emerge continuously many concerns are to be scrutinized [3]. The lack of a shared conceptual framework for DTs with an unambiguous terminology [4] complicates cross-functional discussions. Therefore, a systematization of the main dimensions of DTs is proposed in the form of an ontology and a conceptual framework thereof derived. The research questions addressed in this paper are a) «Which dimensions are used to classify and structure DTs in academic literature?», b) «What are the fundamental differences or specifications within these dimensions?» and c) «How do these different specifications relate to each other?» The focus of the research is on the objective to find classification systematics that are a) representing the entire spectrum of DTs, b) universally valid in all DT related domains and c) applicable in research and practice. A systematic literature review on the relevant aspects of DTs was conducted and the findings iteratively advanced within workshop sessions with academic experts. DTs are considered as integrators of physical and digital worlds as well as internal and external value creation. Further, the creation of DTs requires per definition the use of digital data. Hence, the proposed ontology and conceptual framework for DTs include the following main dimensions to consider for every DT: Data resources, external value creation and internal value creation. The main subdimensions of the data resources are the data sources to obtain the data, the data categories and the data formats. The main subdimension of the external value creation are the attributes of the services as the basis of the value propositions, the level of smartness of the connected products and the actors on the different levels of the ecosystem. The main subdimensions of the internal value creation are the lifecycle phases of products, the product management levels and the different generations of both. The proposed ontology and conceptual framework support researchers and practitioners in positioning and structuring their intended DT activities and communicating them to internal and external stakeholders. The holistic view on the data resource dimension further allows to easily deduct the needed data for certain applications or deduct possible applications from already available data.},

	title = {{WoTDT}: an {Extension} of the {WoT} {Thing} {Description} {Ontology} for {Digital} {Twins} in the {Construction} {Domain}},
	abstract = {Digital Twins (DTws) are a new category of technologies that enable construction industry to improve the precision of its predictions, make more logical decisions, and develop well-informed plans. To address these problems, it is essential to develop a method for semantically describing the various aspects that model the architecture of a DTw, i.e., representing DTws with formal semantics. This article introduces an extension of the W3C Web of Things (WoT) Thing Descriptions (TD) ontology, called “WoTDT ” (WoT Digital Twin ontology). The WoTDT ontology is based on the most widely adopted architecture that models DTws into five dimensions. Furthermore, since the ontology has been created as a WoT extension, it will offer benefits such as enabling the discovery of services [1] across dimensions or enhancing the accessibility [2] of the information from a specific dimension, thereby promoting data interoperability. In addition, an evaluation of the ontology has been performed to ensure its quality by verifying that it is pitfall-free and covers all identified requirements. Finally, an example of the WoTDT ontology applicability is shown in the context of the European H2020 construction-related project COGITO.},
