The evolution of increasingly complex systems requires that their information be organized and managed via digital twins. In addition, the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) will result in an increasing degree of system complexity. These complex systems will exhibit true emergent behavior as AIs modify system aspects as the result of goal seeking and learning. DTs will need to increase in capability, becoming intelligent in their approach. This article presents a discussion on how these Intelligent Digital Twins (IDTs) will evolve and assist in developing and managing complex systems.},

  abstractnote = {The Digital Twin (DT) is a concept introduced at the beginning of the twenty-first century but did not gain traction until the middle of the last decade. It is a concept that was first adopted for tangible industrial products and has since expanded to all manner of products and services. This includes not only application to inanimate entities but also to the biological conditions of people. Digital Twins are rapidly moving into the intangible realm of processes and abstract ideas. The Digital Twin consists of different types to be a framework for the entire lifecycle of the entities. While the Digital Twin today is a concept that is created by its users, the prediction is that its evolution is to be an intelligent platform. This will allow work to move from the physical world into the virtual world with major impacts on efficiency and effectiveness.},

The aim of this paper is to provide a categorical literature review of the DT in manufacturing and to classify existing publication according to their level of integration of the DT. Therefore, it is distinct between Digital Model (DM), Digital Shadow (DS) and Digital Twin. The results are showing, that literature concerning the highest development stage, the DT, is scarce, whilst there is more literature about DM and DS.}

In the future, everything in the physical world would be replicated in the digital space through digital twin technology. As a cutting-edge technology, digital twin has received a lot of attention. However, digital twin is far from realizing their potential, which is a complex system and long-drawn process. Researchers must model all the different parts of the objects or systems. Varied types of data needed to be collected and merged. Many researchers and participators in engineering are not clear which technologies and tools should be used. 5-dimension digital twin model provides reference guidance for understanding and implementing digital twin. From the perspective of 5-dimension digital twin model, this paper tries to investigate and summarize the frequently-used enabling technologies and tools for digital twin to provide technologies and tools references for the applications of digital twin in the future.}

  abstractnote = {Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology surrounded by many promises, and potentials to reshape the future of industries and society overall. A DT is a system-of-systems which goes far beyond the traditional computer-based simulations and analysis. It is a replication of all the elements, processes, dynamics, and firmware of a physical system into a digital counterpart. The two systems (physical and digital) exist side by side, sharing all the inputs and operations using real-time data communications and information transfer. With the incorporation of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), 3D models, next generation mobile communications (5G/6G), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), distributed computing, Transfer Learning (TL), and electronic sensors, the digital/virtual counterpart of the real-world system is able to provide seamless monitoring, analysis, evaluation and predictions. The DT offers a platform for the testing and analysing of complex systems, which would be impossible in traditional simulations and modular evaluations. However, the development of this technology faces many challenges including the complexities in effective communication and data accumulation, data unavailability to train Machine Learning (ML) models, lack of processing power to support high fidelity twins, the high need for interdisciplinary collaboration, and the absence of standardized development methodologies and validation measures. Being in the early stages of development, DTs lack sufficient documentation. In this context, this survey paper aims to cover the important aspects in realization of the technology. The key enabling technologies, challenges and prospects of DTs are highlighted. The paper provides a deep insight into the technology, lists design goals and objectives, highlights design challenges and limitations across industries, discusses research and commercial developments, provides its applications and use cases, offers case studies in industry, infrastructure and healthcare, lists main service providers and stakeholders, and covers developments to date, as well as viable research dimensions for future developments in DTs.},

  abstractnote = {Nowadays, along with the application of new generation information technologies in industry and manufacturing, the big data-driven manufacturing era is coming. However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed. The detailed application methods and frameworks of digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing, and service are investigated. Furthermore, three cases are given to illustrate the future applications of digital twin in the three phases of a product respectively.},

  abstractnote = {The advancing digitization and related topics such as Industry 4.0 are becoming increasingly important for companies. Digital Twin is one of the most popular terms in the context of Industry 4.0. While not new, this approach has been brought to life with recent technological advances. Digital twins of products should help to analyze their life cycle and optimize development, operation, and service processes. For that, the necessary data must be collected and stored throughout the product life cycle and can also be provided for other tasks. The data is usually available in different formats and at different endpoints. Collection and integration of data into existing information systems are also complicated due to the typically large amount of data and typically manageable only with great effort. The structure and design of the digital twin are currently not standardized. Different are the structures, scope, and design methods. Regardless of building techniques and structure, a digital twin building platform must be defined to bring together models and data from different disciplines and to ensure the benefit of using the digital twin. In the present work, the various platforms that can be used to create a digital twin are examined and compared, since each platform has advantages and disadvantages.},

  abstractnote = {Digital twins are expected to form a network, a “Digital Twin Web,” in the future. Digital Twin Web follows a similar structure to the World Wide Web and consists of meta-level digital twins that are described as digital twin description documents and distributed via Digital Twin Web servers. Standards must be established before the Digital Twin Web can be used efficiently, and having an easily accessible server implementation can foster the development of those standards. Twinbase is an open-source, Git-based Digital Twin Web server developed with user-friendliness in mind. Twinbase stores digital twin documents in a Git repository, modifies them with Git workflows, and distributes them to users via a static web server, from which the documents can be accessed via a client library or a regular web browser. A demo server is available at https://dtw.twinbase.org and new server instances can be initialized free-of-charge at GitHub via its browser interface. Twinbase is built with GitHub repository, Pages, and Actions but can be extended to support other providers or self-hosting. We describe the underlying architecture of Twinbase to support the creation of derivative and alternative server implementations. The Digital Twin Web requires permanent, globally accessible, and transferable identifiers to function properly, and to address this issue, we introduce the concept of digital twin identifier registry. Performance measurements showed that the median response times for fetching a digital twin document from Twinbase varied between 0.4 and 1.2 seconds depending on the identifier registry.},

Ready availability of reusable models, data and tool assets, can help with creation and use of digital twins. A number of digital twin frameworks exist to facilitate creation and use of digital twins. In this paper we propose a digital twin framework to author digital twin assets, create digital twins from reusable assets and make the digital twins available as a service to other users. The proposed framework automates the management of reusable assets, storage, provision of compute infrastructure, communication and monitoring tasks. The users operate at the level of digital twins and delegate the rest of the work to the digital twin as a service framework.},

  abstractnote = {Digital twin (DT) technology has been a topic with academic and industrial coverage in recent years. DTs are intended to be a virtual high-fidelity representation of a physical counterpart. Its complex nature requires several components to create and run a DT, and that is why many DT frameworks have been proposed in the literature. There are also many surveys of DTs, but none that is bottom-up with concrete examples and focused on open-source software. This survey analyzes 14 open-source DT frameworks in 10 different dimensions, which are then categorized in six different groups according to their modeling and technological domain, to present the reader different options for creating and managing DT applications, and to understand potential combinations, uses, and limitations of the tools. It also presents a case study with five of the explored DT frameworks, describing the process on how the DT is set up and comparing their capabilities based on the services to be provided by the DT. Finally, it discusses advantages and limitations of the tools according to domain, requirements, and scope, relevant aspects regarding built-in simulations and data analytics, theory-to-practice transition, and advantages/disadvantages of using open-source software instead of commercial. Main limitations of the study due to its narrow niche, conclusions, and opportunities for future research regarding the potential room for improvement in terms of out-of-the-box features and services for DTs, are also shown.},

We begin with a high level, but comprehensive review of AI technologies that may be important for Digital Twins. Then we examine the relationship of AI techniques and methods to the progression of capabilities for Digital Twins in general. The properties and architecture of Digital Twins are then analyzed and related to major AI techniques. The objective is to identify those AI technologies that provide a unique advantage in the design and implementation of Digital Twins. The impact on the Digital Twin’s ability to meet end use requirements is illustrated through a simple use case. This points to the importance of including AI from the beginning in the design and construction of Digital Twins. In considering additional use cases we map how AI can be applied to Digital Twins in more complex situations. Finally, we provide general guidelines for inclusion of AI to be incorporated during the design phase of a Digital Twin. This includes the use of AI within the Digital Twin itself and in operations where the context is the larger system that the Digital Twin supports.},

This study reviews the literature at the intersection of the two fields, where digital twins integrate an artificial intelligence component. We follow a systematic literature review approach, analyzing a total of 149 related studies. In the assessed literature, a variety of problems are approached with an artificial intelligence-integrated digital twin, demonstrating its applicability across different fields. Our findings indicate that there is a lack of in-depth modeling approaches regarding the digital twin, while many articles focus on the implementation and testing of the artificial intelligence component. The majority of publications do not demonstrate a virtual-to-physical connection between the digital twin and the real-world system. Further, only a small portion of studies base their digital twin on real-time data from a physical system, implementing a physical-to-virtual connection.},
