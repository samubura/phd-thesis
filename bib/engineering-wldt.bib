abstract = {Abstract Digital twin (DT) technology has been a topic with academic and industrial coverage in recent years. DTs are intended to be a virtual high-fidelity representation of a physical counterpart. Its complex nature requires several components to create and run a DT, and that is why many DT frameworks have been proposed in the literature. There are also many surveys of DTs, but none that is bottom-up with concrete examples and focused on open-source software. This survey analyzes 14 open-source DT frameworks in 10 different dimensions, which are then categorized in six different groups according to their modeling and technological domain, to present the reader different options for creating and managing DT applications, and to understand potential combinations, uses, and limitations of the tools. It also presents a case study with five of the explored DT frameworks, describing the process on how the DT is set up and comparing their capabilities based on the services to be provided by the DT. Finally, it discusses advantages and limitations of the tools according to domain, requirements, and scope, relevant aspects regarding built-in simulations and data analytics, theory-to-practice transition, and advantages/disadvantages of using open-source software instead of commercial. Main limitations of the study due to its narrow niche, conclusions, and opportunities for future research regarding the potential room for improvement in terms of out-of-the-box features and services for DTs, are also shown.},

Existing software frameworks for digital twins mainly operate in the cloud and are based on platform-specific solutions, harming interoperability and adaptability. However, it is getting recognized that Internet of Things and digital twins architectures can take advantage of microservices and platform-independent distributed architectures (also on the edge), promoting higher scalability, adaptability, and interoperability. In this context, we introduce WLDT (White Label Digital Twins), a general-purpose library that allows developers to create digital twins in terms of modular, adaptable, and inter-operable software agents. Among different features, WLDT library supports multiple standard protocols, caching, software processing pipeline and metrics monitoring.}

abstract = {IoT systems based on Digital Twins (DTs) — virtual copies of physical objects and systems — can be very effective to enable data-driven services and promote better control and decisions, in particular by exploiting distributed approaches where cloud and edge computing cooperate effectively. In this context, digital twins deployed on the edge represents a new strategic element to design a new wave of distributed cyber-physical applications. Existing approaches are generally focused on fragmented and domain-specific monolithic solutions and are mainly associated to model-driven, simulative or descriptive visions. The idea of extending the DTs role to support last-mile digitalization and interoperability through a set of general purpose and well-defined properties and capabilities is still underinvestigated. In this paper, we present the novel Edge Digital Twins (EDT) architectural model and its implementation, enabling the lightweight replication of physical devices providing an efficient digital abstraction layer to support the autonomous and standard collaboration of things and services. We model the core capabilities with respect to the recent definition of the state of the art, present the software architecture and a prototype implementation. Extensive experimental analysis shows the obtained performance in multiple IoT application contexts and compares them with that of state-of-the-art approaches.},

This paper deals with FOC estimation in a more novel way than methods proposed in literature, by utilizing a reduced-sized feature set, which allows predicting vessel’s Main-Engine rotational speed (RPM). Furthermore, this work aims to place the deployment of such models in the broader context of a cutting-edge information system, to improve efficiency and regulatory adherence. Specifically, we integrate B-Splines in the context of two Deep Learning architectures and compare their performance against state-of-the-art regression techniques.

The sharp increase in changing customer demands has resulted in factories transitioning rapidly and yielding shorter product life cycles. Traditional modeling and simulation approaches are not suited to handle such scenarios. As a possible solution, we propose a generic data-driven framework for automated generation of simulation models as basis for digital twins for smart factories. The novelty of our proposed framework is in the data-driven approach that exploits advancements in machine learning and process mining techniques, as well as continuous model improvement and validation. The goal of the framework is to minimize and fully define, or even eliminate, the need for expert knowledge in the extraction of the corresponding simulation models. We illustrate our framework through a case study.},

However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed. The detailed application methods and frameworks of digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing, and service are investigated. Furthermore, three cases are given to illustrate the future applications of digital twin in the three phases of a product respectively.},

Digital Twins provide information about and services based on their physical counterpart's current condition, history and predicted future. They are the building blocks of a vision of future Digital Factories where stakeholders collaborate via the information Digital Twins provide about physical assets in the factory and throughout the product lifecycle. Digital Twins may also contribute to more flexible and resilient Digital Factories. To achieve this, Digital Twins will need to evolve from today's expert-centric tools towards active entities which extend the capabilities of their physical counterparts. Required features include sensing and processing their environment and situation, pro-actively communicating with each other, taking decisions towards their own or cooperative goals, and adapting themselves and their physical counterparts to achieve those goals. Future Digital Twins will need to be context-aware, autonomous, and adaptive. This paper aims to establish a roadmap for this evolution. It sets the scene by proposing a working definition of Digital Twins and examines the state-of-the-art in the three topics in their relation to DTs. It then elaborates potentials for each topic mapped against the working definition, to finally identify research gaps allowing for the definition of a roadmap towards the full realisation of autonomous, context-aware, adaptive Digital Twins as building blocks of tomorrow's Digital Factories.},

This shift is driven by technological advances, including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning, sensor networks and Internet of Things technologies, cloud computing, additive manufacturing, and the availability of large amounts of data that can be exploited by these technologies. However, the adoption of AI technologies for I4.0 varies considerably among industry sectors. This article complements broader reviews of I4.0 by examining the specific applications of IAI in several industry sectors, highlighting the issues and concerns encountered in and across different industry sectors, and discussing potential solutions that have been introduced along with opportunities and challenges for adoption. In this article, we review the literature to identify common themes and concerns related to the adoption of AI technologies in the context of I4.0 in several industry sectors. AI solutions are discussed in the context of an AI adoption pipeline that spans data collection, processing, model construction, and interpretation of results. Our findings indicate that although different industries share common issues, the adopted solutions are often specific to a particular industry sector, which may be difficult to transfer to other sectors. Moreover, industry sectors may pursue different adoption strategies due to varying experience and maturity of AI practices. These findings may inform managers, practitioners, and decision-makers who are involved in the adaptation of Industry 4.0 transformation in their respective industry sectors.},

To address this issue, a proactive material handling method for CPS enabled shop-floor (CPS-PMH) is proposed. Firstly, the manufacturing resources (machines and trolleys) are made smart by applying CPS technologies so that they are able to sense, act, interact and behave within a smart environment. Secondly, a shop-floor digital twin model is created, aiming to reflect their status just like real-life objects, and key production performance indicators can be analysed timely. Then, a time-weighted multiple linear regression method (TWMLR) is proposed to forecast the remaining processing time of WIPs. A proactive material handling model is designed to allocate smart trolleys optimally. Finally, a case study from Southern China is used to validate the proposed method and results show that the proposed CPS-PMH can largely reduce the total non-value-added energy consumption of manufacturing resources and optimize the routes of smart trolleys.},

It is used slightly different over the disparate disciplines. The aim of this paper is to provide a categorical literature review of the DT in manufacturing and to classify existing publication according to their level of integration of the DT. Therefore, it is distinct between Digital Model (DM), Digital Shadow (DS) and Digital Twin. The results are showing, that literature concerning the highest development stage, the DT, is scarce, whilst there is more literature about DM and DS.}

In the future, everything in the physical world would be replicated in the digital space through digital twin technology. As a cutting-edge technology, digital twin has received a lot of attention. However, digital twin is far from realizing their potential, which is a complex system and long-drawn process. Researchers must model all the different parts of the objects or systems. Varied types of data needed to be collected and merged. Many researchers and participators in engineering are not clear which technologies and tools should be used. 5-dimension digital twin model provides reference guidance for understanding and implementing digital twin. From the perspective of 5-dimension digital twin model, this paper tries to investigate and summarize the frequently-used enabling technologies and tools for digital twin to provide technologies and tools references for the applications of digital twin in the future.}, journal={Journal of Manufacturing Systems}, author={Qi, Qinglin and Tao, Fei and Hu, Tianliang and Anwer, Nabil and Liu, Ang and Wei, Yongli and Wang, Lihui and Nee, A.

First, DT can be easily confused with Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Second, the constituents of DT applications in this sector are not well-defined. Also, what the DT can bring to the civil engineering industry is still ambiguous. To address these problems, we reviewed 468 articles related to DT, BIM and CPS, proposed a DT definition and its constituents in civil engineering and compared DT with BIM and CPS. Then we reviewed 134 papers related to DT in the civil engineering sector out of 468 papers in detail. We extracted DT research clusters based on the co-occurrence analysis of paper keywords' and the relevant DT constituents. This research helps establish the state-of-the-art of DT in the civil engineering sector and suggests future DT development.}

Numerous advantages accrue from the energy industry's adoption of DT technology, such as improved asset performance, higher profits and efficiencies, and less harmful effects on the environment. This paper's goal is to present a literature evaluation that classifies DT principles, usage patterns, and benefits in the energy sector. A thorough literature review covering the past decade of studies on DT in the energy sector was conducted. The originality of this study is in-depth examination of DT's use across the whole energy value chain from power generation and storage to energy usage in buildings, transportation, and industrial applications. From this analysis, it was clear that there is a growing interest in using DT in the energy industry and minimizing energy use is the primary focus of the literature on digital twins. Growth of DT technologies will be aided by recent developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence, as well as the development of more sophisticated control systems, allowing for the enhancement of energy system efficiency and effectiveness, thereby fostering the clean energy transition, and reshaping the future of energy.}

In this paper, overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) is described as one such performance-measurement tool that measures different types of production losses and indicates areas of process improvement. Analysis is done on how OEE has evolved leading to other tools like total equipment effectiveness performance, production equipment effectiveness, overall factory effectiveness, overall plant effectiveness, and overall asset effectiveness. Two industrial examples of OEE application are discussed, and the differences between theory and practice analysed. Finally, a framework for classifying and measuring production losses for overall production effectiveness is proposed. The framework harmonizes the differences between theory and practice and makes possible the presentation of overall production/asset effectiveness that can be customized with the manufacturers needs to improve productivity.},
